Processing of (potential) customers’ data and third parties’ data provided by (potential) customers

The provision of translation, sworn translation and proofreading services involves receiving and processing documents that may contain personal data of clients, potential clients and third parties. The documents provided by potential clients will only be used to prepare a translation, sworn translation or proofreading quote. If the quote is rejected, the documents will be deleted immediately; if the quote is accepted, they will be deleted when the service provision is concluded; and if the client fails to reply, they will be deleted a month after the quote was requested. By accepting the quote, the client allows the service provider to process the data contained in the documents provided in accordance with the contracted service and to store them until the service is completed. None of these data will be passed on to third parties without the explicit permission of the client or potential client, unless required by law.

The client’s or potential client’s tax data may be used to prepare the quote for the requested service and, if applicable, the invoice for the service provided. These tax data will be kept for as long as necessary to comply with legal obligations and to assume any liabilities that may arise from the service provided. None of these data will be passed on to third parties without the explicit permission of the client or potential client, unless required by law.

The client or potential client has the right to access, correct and delete the data provided and to cancel or limit its processing by the data controller. To do so, the client or potential client should write to the data controller at the e-mail address below. If the client or potential client considers that his/her rights have not been fully satisfied, he/she may complain to the Spanish Data Protection Agency (c/ Jorge Juan, 6 – 28001 Madrid).
